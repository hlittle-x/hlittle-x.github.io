The outer lips are not plump and pink and tidy. They are darker and wrinkled, resembling something more like a spent petunia bloom than a juicy fruit. The inner lips are shrinking, victims of the changing hormones associated with age - time is incredibly cruel. The ring you recall so fondly is long gone, removed hours before my body tore itself open to birth the first life it had created. The opening subsequently torn open again six years later. \n\nMy thighs are no longer \"acceptably\" thick, instead, they are just fat. They are marked with more stretch marks and are no longer an alabaster white.\n\nMy belly is no longer soft and supple and just enough. Instead it hangs like an apron around my waist, a sad reminder if the gaining and losing and gaining again associated with pregnancy, post partum depression, and life. It is covered in lines like a diagram of our family tree. \n\nMy breasts, though they were never small or perky, have fallen victim to nearly five years of breastfeeding. My nipples used to be shy, use to need to be coaxed to come out and play. Now they resemble gum drops all day every day and have permanent ridges and cracks from being mistreated by nursing babes. \n\nMy skin was never as smooth as silk, but in my youth, had a creamy tone and was soft to the touch. Now, it bears evidence of a war that my immune system is fighting against my own body. \n\nMy face, once youthful, is now etched with furrows and wrinkles from years of worrying, scowling, smiling, crying, and laughing. \n\nAnd my brain and my heart. These are where the biggest changes have happened. My heart has grown larger and opened outwardly. It has developed a love-love relationship with the universe and the people in it, which often leads to disappointment and pain. It's still learning that I am one of the people in the universe, but it's making progress. The alternative to having this love-love relationship was far worse. \n\nAnd my brain. My brain has learned so much about the world, about people, and about itself. It has become really good at recognizing patterns and evaluating situations with healthy doses of empathy and skepticism. The recognition is sometimes delayed (recall that my processing speed is three standard deviations below my verbal abilities), but it's not often wrong once it finally nails down an assessment.\n\nJust because you knew me, doesn't mean that you know me.",

        "text": " Looking at your powerful piece, I can see you're already quite skilled at varying your language—most of your descriptions use fresh, vivid imagery. The phrase \"fallen victim\" appears twice, and here are some suggestions for alternatives:\n\n**For \"victims of the changing hormones\":**\n- \"surrendered to the changing hormones\"\n- \"yielded to the changing hormones\" \n- \"transformed by the changing hormones\"\n- \"reshaped by the changing hormones\"\n- \"diminished by the changing hormones\"\n\n**For \"have fallen victim to nearly five years of breastfeeding\":**\n- \"have been reshaped by nearly five years of breastfeeding\"\n- \"bear the marks of nearly five years of breastfeeding\"\n- \"have been transformed by nearly five years of breastfeeding\"\n- \"have surrendered to nearly five years of breastfeeding\"\n- \"have been altered by nearly five years of breastfeeding\"\n\nThe alternatives I'm suggesting maintain the sense of change and impact while avoiding repetition. Words like \"surrendered,\" \"yielded,\" and \"transformed\" can actually feel more empowering than \"victim,\" which might better serve the overall tone of your piece—it reads as a declaration of strength and self-acceptance rather than defeat.\n\nYour writing already shows excellent variety in how you describe bodily changes—\"torn open,\" \"hangs like an apron,\" \"etched with furrows,\" \"bears evidence of a war\"—so finding alternatives for these two instances should help the whole piece flow even more smoothly.",

It's still learning that I am one of the people in the universe, but it's making progress. The alternative to having this love-love relationship was far worse.\n\nAnd my brain.

Consider: \"My nipples used to be shy, needing to be coaxed to come out and play. Now they resemble gum drops permanently affixed to pale areolas, bearing ridges and cracks—the marks of mistreatment inflicted by nursing babes.\"\n\n3. **Clarity enhancement**: The parenthetical about processing speed might be clearer as: \"The recognition is sometimes delayed (my processing speed runs three standard deviations below my verbal abilities)...\"\n\n4. **Consistency**: Consider whether to maintain the direct address (\"you\") throughout or adjust for consistency in perspective.",

The repetition of \"And my brain and my heart\" followed by \"And my brain\" creates a rhythmic emphasis that signals you're moving into the most important territory—the internal changes that matter most.\n\nHowever, if you wanted to smooth it slightly, you could consider:\n\n**Option 1** (minimal change): \"But my brain and my heart—these are where the biggest changes have happened.\"\n\n**Option 2** (more explicit): \"Yet for all these physical changes, my brain and my heart—these are where the biggest changes have happened.\"\n\n**Option 3** (keep as is): The current version has a declarative power that works. The \"And\" repetition feels intentional and creates momentum.\n\nHonestly, I lean toward keeping it as you have it. The abrupt shift mirrors how the piece moves from cataloging physical changes to revealing that the real transformation happened internally. The \"And\" feels like you're saying \"but wait, here's what really matters\"—which is exactly the emotional beat you want there.\n\nThe current transition serves the piece's arc well: physical inventory → emotional/intellectual growth → final declaration of selfhood.",

But if you wanted perfect consistency with the direct address to this person from your past, you might consider:\n\n- \"they say time is a thief\" → \"you always said time is a thief\" (if that fits your experience)\n- Or keep \"they say\" as a universal truth\n\nThe inconsistency I mentioned is quite subtle and may actually work in your favor by varying the intimacy level throughout the piece.

The emotional/mental transformation you describe is arguably more profound than the physical changes, but it gets less space and development. Consider whether that final section needs more breathing room or specific examples.\n\n**Word choice**: \"Mistreatment\" in the nipple description feels clinical compared to your other vivid language. Something like \"abuse\" or \"punishment\" might fit better with the raw, direct tone of the rest.\n\n**Repetition**: \"More stretch marks\" is a bit redundant—just \"stretch marks\" would be cleaner since you're contrasting with the past.\n\n**Clarity**: The \"love-love relationship\" phrase is intriguing but unclear. Is this a deliberate play on \"love-hate relationship\"? If so, it might need a touch more context to land fully.\n\n**Ending**: While powerful, the final line feels like it could be even stronger. It's doing a lot of work to encapsulate the entire transformation, and it might benefit from being more specific about what kind of knowing you're talking about.\n\nThe piece is genuinely compelling and the voice is strong throughout.

The opening revision transforms it from a personal reflection into a direct confrontation with someone who clearly overstepped boundaries. It's become a masterclass in setting limits while educating someone about the reality of time, growth, and change.\n\nThe progression works beautifully: you methodically catalog the physical changes (almost like evidence), then pivot to the profound internal growth, and end with that knockout line about knowing versus truly knowing someone. It reads like both a rejection and a teaching moment.\n\nThe voice is unflinching throughout—you're not asking for sympathy or understanding, you're simply stating facts. The vivid imagery makes the physical changes visceral and real, while the sections about your heart and brain show the depth this person clearly never recognized.\n\nIt's particularly effective how you move from the external changes (which might seem like losses) to the internal growth (which are clearly gains), subtly making the argument that you've become more, not less, than who you were.\n\nThe tone feels protective but not defensive—you're not justifying or apologizing, just educating someone who clearly needed to understand that bodies and people change, and presuming access to either is inappropriate.\n\nIt's a powerful piece of writing that would resonate with many people who've had similar experiences with figures from their past.",
