# Grammar Corrections and Flow Suggestions

## Corrected Version:

The body you knew 21 years ago is not the body I have today.

My pussy is no longer a perfect peach. The outer lips are not plump and pink and tidy. They are darker and wrinkled, resembling something more like a spent petunia bloom than a juicy fruit. The inner lips are shrinking, diminished by the changing hormones associated with age—they say time is a thief. The ring you recall so fondly is long gone, removed hours before my body tore itself open to birth the first life it had created. The opening subsequently torn open again six years later.

My thighs are no longer "acceptably" thick; instead, they are just fat. They are marked with more stretch marks and are no longer an alabaster white.

My belly is no longer soft and supple and just enough. Instead, it hangs like an apron around my waist, a sad reminder of the gaining and losing and gaining again associated with pregnancy, postpartum depression, and life. It is covered in lines like a diagram of our family tree.

My breasts, though they were never small or perky, have been reshaped by nearly five years of breastfeeding. My nipples used to be shy, used to need to be coaxed to come out and play. Now they resemble gum drops, permanently affixed to pale areolas, and bear the marks that tell tales of punishment—ridges and cracks inflicted by nursing babes.

My skin was never as smooth as silk, but in my youth, it had a creamy tone and was soft to the touch. Now, it bears evidence of a war that my immune system is fighting against my own body.

My face, once youthful, is now etched with furrows and wrinkles from years of worrying, scowling, smiling, crying, wondering, and laughing.

And my brain and my heart—these are where the biggest changes have happened. My heart has grown larger and opened outwardly. It has developed a love-love relationship with the universe and the people in it, which often leads to disappointment and pain. It's still learning that I am one of the people in the universe, but it's making progress. The alternative to having this love-love relationship was far worse.

And my brain. My brain has learned so much about the world, about people, and about itself. It has become really good at recognizing patterns and evaluating situations with healthy doses of empathy and skepticism. The recognition is sometimes delayed (my processing speed runs three standard deviations below my verbal abilities), but it's not often wrong once it finally nails down an assessment.

Just because you knew me doesn't mean that you know me.

## Key Grammar Corrections:

1. **"reshapes" → "reshaped"** - Fixed verb tense
2. **"use to" → "used to"** - Corrected common error
3. **"reminder if" → "reminder of"** - Fixed preposition
4. **"post partum" → "postpartum"** - Standard spelling
5. **Comma usage** - Changed semicolon after "thick" for better flow
6. **Maintained original phrasing** - "The opening subsequently torn" kept as written (intentional stylistic choice)
7. **Em dash consistency** - Standardized punctuation
8. **"Just because you knew me, doesn't mean" → "Just because you knew me doesn't mean"** - Removed unnecessary comma

## Flow and Clarity Suggestions:

### Strengths:
- Powerful parallel structure moving from physical to emotional/mental
- Vivid, tactile imagery throughout
- Strong opening and closing that bookend the piece beautifully

### Areas for Enhancement:

1. **Transition smoothness**: Consider adding a brief transition before "And my brain and my heart" to signal the shift from physical to emotional/mental changes.

2. **Sentence rhythm**: The paragraph about nipples has some choppiness. Consider: "My nipples used to be shy, needing to be coaxed to come out and play. Now they resemble gum drops permanently affixed to pale areolas, bearing ridges and cracks—the marks of mistreatment inflicted by nursing babes."

3. **Clarity enhancement**: The parenthetical about processing speed might be clearer as: "The recognition is sometimes delayed (my processing speed runs three standard deviations below my verbal abilities)..."

4. **Consistency**: Consider whether to maintain the direct address ("you") throughout or adjust for consistency in perspective.
