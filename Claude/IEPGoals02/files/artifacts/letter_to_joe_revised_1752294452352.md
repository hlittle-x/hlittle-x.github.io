I'm scared to tell you this, but I need to be honest about what I'm feeling. I know having a face-to-face conversation would be best, but when I think about bringing these things up, my words get stuck in my chest. I want to reassure you this isn't about conflict, it's about wanting to feel more connected.

I want hugs. I want affection. I want you to reach for me when I move close. I want to cuddle. I want reassurance that you still have any desire to touch me. I want to feel like you want me to touch you. I want you to tell me you love me without me having to say it first. 

I want you to follow me when it's obvious I'm upset and take me in your arms and comfort me. I want you to grab me and hold me until my body relaxes because I know that you won't be the first to pull away when I ask for a hug. When you do pull away first, or when you don't reach for me, the story I tell myself is that you don't love me - that you think my body is disgusting and you're repulsed by my touch. I know this might be completely off base, or maybe there's more to it that I'm not seeing, but it's the narrative my brain constructs in those moments.

I feel cared about, but I also want to feel cared for, physically and emotionally. I want to feel like more than a housemate and coparent. 

Over the years, I lied to everyone, myself included. It wasn't malicious or intentional, it just happened. I tried to make myself easy to love, to not have needs, because I didn't think anyone would want to make an effort. I said acts of service was the key, and I convinced myself that was true, because it felt like the easiest way for anyone to love me without demanding too much for just myself. I told people I wasn't a hugger, because I didn't think people would actually want to hug me. And I certainly didn't deserve words of affirmation, so acts of service made the most sense. "Could you do me a big favor? If not, that's okay." followed by an embarrassingly simple request like "Can you carry that basket of laundry upstairs?" or "Can you hold the door for me?" became an easy way of asking for a display of love or care. 

But this version of me that has new information about who I am and how my nervous system works has a new understanding of a lot of things. I've masked my real needs for so long that I completely forgot what they were. I think that my nervous system actually craves clear, focused connection - not just gentle background affection, but intentional touch and direct communication that helps me feel safe in my body and in our relationship. I need presence and certainty to feel connected - to know that touch and affection are wanted, not just tolerated. I want agency in our intimacy - I want to feel like you want me to touch you and please you too.

I know my body has changed over the years, and I need to know where I stand. I need honesty about whether you still want me in that way, even if that conversation is hard.
