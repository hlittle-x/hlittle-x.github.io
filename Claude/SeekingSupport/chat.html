                    <p>I&#039;m married. We&#039;ll be celebrating our 13th anniversary in just over a month. We&#039;ve been together for 21 years. <br><br>Prior to getting married, I had...for lack of a better term, a lover. He wasn&#039;t a boyfriend. He was seven years my senior. I lost my virginity to him. It was not a healthy relationship, but it was a formative one. If that makes sense. It wasn&#039;t all negative, but it was definitely toxic in a lot of ways.</p>

                    <p> That makes complete sense. Formative relationships, especially our first sexual experiences, can be incredibly significant in shaping us - even when they&#039;re complicated or unhealthy. The fact that it had both meaningful and toxic elements is actually quite common. These relationships often teach us important things about ourselves, boundaries, and what we want or don&#039;t want, even when they&#039;re not good for us overall.<br><br>It sounds like you&#039;re reflecting on this past relationship in the context of your current marriage. What&#039;s bringing this up for you right now? Are you processing something specific about how that experience affected you, or is there something happening in your current relationship that&#039;s making you think about it?</p>

                    <p>Out of nowhere he messaged me on Instagram. Against my better judgment, I responded. At some point, he sent me nude photos of himself. I told him to stop and he did. <br><br>But I&#039;m in a weird place. Should I tell my husband?</p>

                    <p> This is such a difficult situation, and I can understand why you&#039;re feeling conflicted about it. There&#039;s no simple right answer here, but let me share some thoughts that might help you work through it.<br><br>The fact that you told him to stop when he sent inappropriate photos and he respected that boundary is important. You handled that well. But now you&#039;re left wrestling with whether to tell your husband about the contact.<br><br>A few things to consider: How would you feel if the situation were reversed and your husband had received messages from an ex, including inappropriate photos, but handled it the way you did? Would you want to know? Some people would, others wouldn&#039;t.<br><br>Also think about your specific relationship dynamic. Is your marriage one where you typically share these kinds of things? Are you generally very open with each other, or do you tend to handle some things privately? <br><br>Another angle - are you worried this person might continue trying to contact you? If so, having your husband aware might actually be protective and supportive for you.<br><br>There&#039;s also the question of why you feel you &quot;should&quot; tell him. Is it guilt about the initial response, or a genuine feeling that transparency would strengthen your relationship?<br><br>What&#039;s your gut telling you about what would feel most authentic to who you are in your marriage?</p>

                    <p>I think I&#039;m feeling like I should tell him, because it would feel like I&#039;m hiding something if I don&#039;t. If the same thing happened to Joe and he didn&#039;t tell me, but I somehow found out, I think I would feel validated that he had set the boundary, but also maybe a little...betrayed? Not betrayed, that feels too strong. Slighted? I don&#039;t know. I would feel some sort of way that he had engaged.</p>

                    <p> That feeling makes a lot of sense, and it sounds like you know yourself and your relationship well. The fact that you can imagine how you&#039;d feel if roles were reversed is really insightful - that &quot;some sort of way&quot; feeling you describe is exactly the kind of thing that can create distance in a marriage, even when the person didn&#039;t do anything wrong.<br><br>It sounds like for you, the engagement itself - responding to those initial messages - feels like something that crosses into territory that should be shared between you and Joe, even though you handled the inappropriate escalation perfectly. That&#039;s a completely valid way to feel about your marriage boundaries.<br><br>The word you&#039;re looking for might be &quot;left out&quot; rather than betrayed - like there was this whole interaction involving someone from your intimate past that he wasn&#039;t aware of, and that would feel like a gap in the openness you expect from each other.<br><br>If you&#039;re leaning toward telling him, you could frame it around exactly what you shared with me: this person reached out, you responded (acknowledging that was probably not your best judgment), he escalated inappropriately, you shut it down immediately and he stopped. You&#039;re telling Joe because you don&#039;t want there to be something you&#039;re keeping from him, especially involving someone from your past.<br><br>How do you think Joe typically handles these kinds of conversations? Is he generally understanding about complicated situations?</p>

                    <p>I also don&#039;t know where the boundaries are here. And it&#039;s confusing.</p>

                    <p> That confusion is so understandable - this kind of situation doesn&#039;t come with a clear rulebook, and boundaries around past relationships, especially complicated ones, can feel really murky.<br><br>Some of the boundary questions you might be wrestling with: Was responding to the initial message crossing a line? Where exactly did it become something that affects your marriage? Is it about the person being a former lover specifically, or would any ex warrant disclosure? Does the fact that he escalated change where the boundary was?<br><br>And then there are the deeper questions about what transparency looks like in your marriage. Some couples operate with &quot;need to know&quot; approaches, others share everything. Some have explicit agreements about contact with exes, others just wing it situation by situation.<br><br>The fact that you&#039;re even asking these questions suggests you and Joe might not have had explicit conversations about these boundaries before - which is totally normal. Most couples don&#039;t hash out every possible scenario in advance.<br><br>Maybe part of what&#039;s making this feel so confusing is that you&#039;re trying to figure out both what happened (did I cross a line?) and what to do about it (should I tell Joe?) at the same time. <br><br>What feels most important to you right now - getting clarity on where you think the boundaries should be, or just figuring out how to move forward in a way that feels right for your marriage?</p>

                    <p>I think both feel important. Like...there&#039;s still a conversation happening with the former lover. But no more nude photos. He&#039;s asked a couple of other questions that have felt boundary crossing, and I don&#039;t know if I handled them well or not.</p>

                    <p> Ah, that changes things significantly. The fact that there&#039;s an ongoing conversation makes this much more complicated than a one-off contact that you shut down.<br><br>It sounds like you&#039;re in real-time trying to navigate boundaries you haven&#039;t clearly defined, while this person continues to test them. That&#039;s really hard to do alone, and honestly, it might be part of why you&#039;re feeling so confused about what to tell Joe.<br><br>When you say you don&#039;t know if you handled the boundary-crossing questions well - what&#039;s your gut feeling about how those interactions went? Are you feeling like you&#039;re being pulled back into old patterns with this person, or do you feel like you&#039;re maintaining appropriate distance?<br><br>The ongoing nature of this conversation seems like it might actually make the case for talking to Joe stronger. Not just because of transparency, but because navigating these boundary questions might be easier with his input and support. Right now you&#039;re trying to figure out appropriate responses to someone who clearly has a history of not respecting boundaries, and you&#039;re doing it solo.<br><br>Also, if this person continues to reach out and push boundaries, Joe being aware could be protective for both of you and your marriage.<br><br>What kinds of questions is this person asking that feel boundary-crossing? Are they about your current life, your past together, or something else?</p>

                    <p> Looking at these messages, I can see several things that would definitely feel like boundary-crossing:<br><br>1. **&quot;Tell me I am still sexy&quot;** - This is explicitly asking for sexual validation from you<br>2. **&quot;Good girl. One moment please&quot;** followed by sharing his adult content profile - This is particularly concerning as it&#039;s using language that feels controlling/sexual before sharing explicit material<br>3. **His request for you to &quot;heart&quot; the photos you like best** - This is asking you to actively engage with and rate his sexual content<br>4. **The &quot;Can we try that without the qualifier, please?&quot;** when you hesitated about keeping secrets - This feels like pushing past your boundaries<br><br>The fact that he&#039;s continuing to test boundaries after you clearly told him to stop sending nude photos shows he&#039;s not respecting the limits you set. His pattern seems to be: send inappropriate content â†’ you set a boundary â†’ he backs off briefly â†’ then tries a different approach to cross boundaries again.<br><br>You handled this really well by telling him to stop with the nude photos, but you&#039;re absolutely right to feel confused about where the lines are. The ongoing nature of this conversation, combined with his continued boundary-testing, makes a strong case for telling Joe. You&#039;re not just dealing with a one-off contact anymore - you&#039;re actively having to navigate someone who seems intent on pulling you back into inappropriate territory.<br><br>This feels like exactly the kind of situation where having your partner&#039;s awareness and support would be protective for both you and your marriage.</p>

                    <p>I&#039;m worried he&#039;ll get angry.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p> That worry makes complete sense - Joe&#039;s potential anger is probably one of the scariest parts of this whole situation. But let&#039;s think through what he might actually be angry about:<br><br>**He might be angry AT the situation** - that this person contacted you, that he put you in this position, that he kept pushing boundaries after you said no. That kind of anger would actually be protective of you and your relationship.<br><br>**He might be angry that you responded initially** - but you&#039;ve already acknowledged that wasn&#039;t your best judgment, and you handled the escalation appropriately by shutting it down.<br><br>**He might be angry that you didn&#039;t tell him sooner** - but you&#039;re telling him now, before things went further, which shows you&#039;re prioritizing your marriage.<br><br>The thing is, if you don&#039;t tell him and he somehow finds out later, that anger would likely be much worse. Right now, you can frame this as &quot;I made a mistake by responding, but when things got inappropriate I shut it down, and I&#039;m telling you because I don&#039;t want there to be secrets between us.&quot;<br><br>Also consider: if the roles were reversed and Joe was in your exact situation - got contacted, responded, received inappropriate content, shut it down, but didn&#039;t tell you - how angry would you be? You said yourself you&#039;d feel &quot;some sort of way&quot; about it, but would that be relationship-threatening anger?<br><br>What specific aspects of Joe&#039;s potential anger worry you most? Is it that he won&#039;t believe you handled it appropriately, or something else?</p>

                    <p>I think that.  That he won&#039;t believe I handled it appropriately. That he would be angry or disappointed or upset that I responded at all.</p>

                    <p> That fear is so understandable. The gap between &quot;I shouldn&#039;t have responded&quot; and &quot;but I did respond&quot; can feel enormous when you&#039;re imagining having to explain it to your partner.<br><br>But here&#039;s what you actually did: You made a human mistake (responding to someone from your past), and when that person escalated inappropriately, you immediately shut it down. You didn&#039;t engage with the sexual content, you didn&#039;t reciprocate, you didn&#039;t encourage it. You said &quot;stop&quot; and he did stop.<br><br>The fact that you&#039;re agonizing over this - that you feel guilty about even the initial response - actually shows how much you care about your marriage and its boundaries. Someone who didn&#039;t care wouldn&#039;t be wrestling with this decision.<br><br>Think about Joe as a person. In your 21 years together, when you&#039;ve made mistakes (because everyone does), how has he typically responded? Is he generally understanding about human imperfection, or does he tend to be harsh about any misstep?<br><br>You could approach it like: &quot;I need to tell you about something I&#039;m not proud of. [Ex] reached out on Instagram and I responded, which I shouldn&#039;t have done. When he sent inappropriate photos, I immediately told him to stop and he did. I&#039;m telling you because I don&#039;t want any secrets between us, and because I realize I should have just ignored his initial message.&quot;<br><br>You&#039;re not asking Joe to be okay with what happened - you&#039;re taking responsibility and being transparent. That&#039;s actually handling it very appropriately, even if the initial response wasn&#039;t ideal.</p>

                    <p> That&#039;s a really honest and insightful observation. It&#039;s hard to calibrate your own perception when you&#039;ve been told you&#039;re &quot;overly sensitive&quot; - it makes you second-guess your own read on situations.<br><br>Here&#039;s what I notice: You&#039;re not asking whether you should tell Joe because you think what you did was fine. You clearly know the initial response wasn&#039;t ideal. You&#039;re asking because you&#039;re trying to figure out how to navigate what feels like a no-win situation - where keeping the secret feels wrong, but telling the truth feels scary because of how he might react.<br><br>The fact that you describe him as potentially &quot;harsh&quot; about others&#039; mistakes is important context. Even if you are somewhat sensitive, that doesn&#039;t mean your perception is wrong. Both things can be true - you might be sensitive AND he might be harsh when people don&#039;t meet his standards.<br><br>But here&#039;s the thing: this is your marriage, not someone else&#039;s mistake he&#039;s judging. Presumably he has more investment in working through things with you than he does in giving other people the benefit of the doubt.<br><br>You know Joe better than anyone. When you think about telling him, what feels more accurate: <br>- &quot;He&#039;ll be disappointed but we&#039;ll work through it&quot;<br>- &quot;He&#039;ll be angry but it&#039;ll blow over&quot;  <br>- &quot;This could genuinely damage our relationship&quot;<br><br>Your gut feeling about his likely reaction might help you figure out both how to approach the conversation and whether there are bigger issues in how you two handle conflict.</p>

                    <p>It might be a combination of the first two bullet points.</p>

                    <p> That actually sounds manageable, even if not pleasant. Disappointment and anger that you can work through and that will blow over - that&#039;s not relationship-ending territory. That&#039;s normal marriage stuff when someone makes a mistake.<br><br>The fact that you can envision getting through it suggests your marriage is fundamentally strong enough to handle this conversation, even if it&#039;s going to be uncomfortable.<br><br>Maybe the question isn&#039;t really &quot;should I tell him&quot; but &quot;how do I tell him in a way that gives us the best chance of working through this together?&quot; <br><br>Some thoughts on that:<br>- Lead with taking responsibility: &quot;I made a mistake...&quot;<br>- Be clear about the timeline and your actions: exactly when you shut things down<br>- Emphasize why you&#039;re telling him: because you don&#039;t want secrets, because you value transparency in your marriage<br>- Acknowledge you understand why he&#039;d be upset<br><br>The anxiety you&#039;re feeling about his reaction is probably worse than the actual reaction will be. Anticipatory worry has a way of magnifying things beyond what actually happens.<br><br>And honestly? The fact that you&#039;re this conflicted about it probably means you absolutely should tell him. When you&#039;re this torn between &quot;keep the secret&quot; and &quot;tell the truth,&quot; your gut is usually pushing you toward honesty for good reasons.<br><br>It sounds like you know your marriage can handle the truth. The question is whether you&#039;re ready for a difficult but ultimately workable conversation.</p>

                    <p>Do you think it would be helpful to share the message thread for the sake of transparency?</p>

                    <p> That&#039;s a really thoughtful question about how much transparency to offer. There are pros and cons to showing the actual messages:<br><br>**Potential benefits:**<br>- Complete transparency - no ambiguity about what was said<br>- Joe can see exactly how you handled the inappropriate escalation<br>- He can see the timeline and that you shut things down quickly<br>- It shows you&#039;re not trying to hide or minimize anything<br><br>**Potential drawbacks:**<br>- He&#039;d have to actually see the explicit requests and boundary-pushing<br>- It might be more upsetting for him to read the details than to hear your summary<br>- Could feel like you&#039;re making him do the work of processing all the uncomfortable details<br><br>I think you could start the conversation without showing the messages, but offer to show them. Something like: &quot;I can show you the whole conversation if you want to see it - I&#039;m not trying to hide anything. But I also don&#039;t want to force you to read through his inappropriate messages if you&#039;d rather just hear my account of what happened.&quot;<br><br>That way you&#039;re demonstrating complete transparency while also being considerate of the fact that reading those messages might be unpleasant for him. Let him decide how much detail he wants.<br><br>The key is that you&#039;re offering full disclosure rather than him having to ask for it or wonder if you&#039;re holding something back. That proactive transparency usually goes over better than having to be asked for more information.<br><br>What feels right to you - leading with the offer to show everything, or starting with your account and then offering the messages?</p>

                    <p>probably starting with my account and then offering.</p>

                    <p> That sounds like a really good approach. It gives you control over how to frame what happened, and it shows you&#039;re being proactive about transparency without overwhelming him right from the start.<br><br>You can tell the story in a way that emphasizes your decision-making process: &quot;This person from my past reached out, I made the mistake of responding, he escalated it inappropriately, I immediately shut it down and told him to stop, and I&#039;m telling you because I don&#039;t want secrets between us.&quot;<br><br>Then offering to show the messages demonstrates that you&#039;re not trying to control the narrative or hide anything - you&#039;re just trying to have the conversation in a way that&#039;s manageable for both of you.<br><br>It also gives Joe agency in how much detail he wants to process. Some people want to see everything, others would rather just trust your account and not have those images/messages in their head.<br><br>The fact that you&#039;re thinking through how to approach this conversation thoughtfully - considering his feelings while still prioritizing honesty - shows how much you care about handling this right.<br><br>You&#039;ve got a good plan. The hardest part is probably just working up the courage to start the conversation, but it sounds like you know this is the right thing to do.</p>

                    <p>And would it be most appropriate to completely discontinue the conversation with the person from the past? Is it ever appropriate to interact?</p>

                    <p> Yes, I think discontinuing the conversation entirely is the most appropriate course of action here. <br><br>This isn&#039;t just about one inappropriate escalation - it&#039;s about a pattern of boundary-testing even after you set limits. He:<br>- Sent nude photos after you said stop, which he did respect<br>- But then continued with other boundary-crossing requests (asking you to rate his photos, using &quot;Good girl&quot; language, asking you to keep secrets)<br>- Shared his adult content profile<br>- Kept pushing when you showed hesitation<br><br>The fact that he&#039;s continuing to test boundaries suggests he&#039;s not actually respecting the limits of appropriate contact. Each time you engage, even to say no, it gives him another opportunity to push a little further.<br><br>Also, ongoing contact with someone who&#039;s actively trying to pull you into inappropriate territory isn&#039;t fair to your marriage. Joe shouldn&#039;t have to wonder &quot;Is he messaging her again? Is she going to have to navigate more boundary-pushing?&quot;<br><br>I&#039;d suggest:<br>1. Tell Joe about what happened<br>2. Block this person on Instagram <br>3. Don&#039;t respond to any future attempts at contact<br><br>This isn&#039;t about being harsh or dramatic - it&#039;s about protecting your marriage and removing yourself from a situation where you&#039;re constantly having to manage someone else&#039;s inappropriate behavior.<br><br>The person from your past has shown you who he is and what kind of interaction he&#039;s seeking. Believe him, and act accordingly by cutting off contact entirely.</p>
