As a recently diagnosed autistic woman, I have always been drawn to more intense sexual and/or erotic experiences. I think I'm going back and reevaluating a lot of things given this relatively new information about myself.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HAbsolutely. I have always over intellectualized and been a cognitive processor, which has made it really hard to "get out of my head" and enjoy sexual experiences. I have had one sexual relationship in particular, my first, where I truly felt like I had to be fully physically present and was able to be in my body. I have had periods with my husband over our nearly 21 year long relationship where that's happened, but I still have difficulties with shutting off my brain and getting into my body.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HYes to structure and ritual, but it's a tricky line to walk, because the ADHD part of my brain seems out novelty.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HI think I find the idea of submission within certain parameters to be incredibly attractive, because being ordered or told what to do provides the novelty, while the dynamic allows for boundaries and clear expectations to be established.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HI haven't. I had the person from the past (my first sexual experience) reappear in my life recently and offer that type of dynamic, but he wanted submission without the benefit of negotiating boundaries or expectations.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HWould you take a look at the email exchange between us and give me feedback?</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>ould you let me know when you might have a moment to talk? I have some questions that I would like a chance to have an earnest discussion about. Not going crazy or losing anything, but just need to discuss ground rules and expectations. I'm trying to approach this like a grown up.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>lso, I understand that you've got a lot going on, so no serious rush. This is not urgent by any means.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>cannot. Things are far too complicated on my end right now (my health and legal sitch, court, my home). As mentioned, I cannot hold up both of us at once. I am doing this (my life) all by myself.When I am overwhelmed with life, I cut out everything that isn't my direct focus. As someone who has attention issues as well, I am sure you can relate.If this means we can't play, then we can't play. If you cannot get by without contact from me, we shouldn't be playing. The choice is yours.I do not mean to hurt you. You have no idea what I am going through right now, and it isn't for me to be talked about at this time.I am sorry. I know this isn't the answer you wanted. But it is honest. In the months ahead my life will clear up considerably. You must understand that this is not you. You have done nothing wrong. I thought you could handle this.  I am sorry for intruding on your life if this is not the case.I have to go. I am in the fight for my life over my rent stabilized Manhattan apartment. It is costing me tens of thousands of dollars a month to fight this. I have 40K in escrow that may be seized. It has been a 2 year battle that is only culminating in the courts as of last week. The NYPD are involved. It is a mess that is truly deserving of my full attention.Don't ask me any questions. I have told you this much to help you  understand that it isn't just a flight of fancy that I am disappearing/going dark. It is extremely serious.I won't be responding until this has evened out. You cannot help (I have three lawyers on this already). If I am distancing myself it is so I can preserve what friendship/play we do have for future possibilities.At the end of the day you have a man and a family and should turn your attentions to them, first and always. I cannot and will not ever fill that role for you. You have to understand this.Please don't make me sorry for rousing our friendship after so many years. You are an adult now. I know you can handle this, and understand that my life here must come first.Take careChristopher</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HThank you for that feedback, though I'm still incredibly disappointed.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HI just wonder if anyone ever finds actual fulfillment in these types of areas.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HI would love to do this within the boundaries of my marriage, but it feels like an incredibly difficult conversation to start.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HRejection and/or dismissiveness is always the biggest fear. Or indifference. Or just that feeling I'd judgement and/or shaming.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HEven though I know he's not going to respond and likely won't contact for quite some time (regardless of whatever's going on financially, housing-wise or health-wise), I find myself checking over and over and over to see if he's responded or if he's online. 😣</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HIt was really nice to be reminded that I was/am desirable. And it feels like a crash to have it gone.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>have been very specific with you. Please leave me alone right now. 
If you write me again I will take that as you not understanding me and block you. Please do not put me in this position. I have not and will not read any of your previous writings until my legal case is done. This could be weeks or months.  Please don't make me regret reaching out to you. Because that is how I am feeling right now.That is all.-CP</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HOkay, actually. Now I'm all up in my head about this. I'm going to share a log of our all of our conversations since he initially reached out as well as a few other things I've sent him. Because I need to know if it's all him or what role I played.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>//hlittle-x.github.io/your_instagram_activity/messages/inbox/lanechristopher_1649462826447083/message_1.html</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>wake up to the sun streaming in through the window illuminating our naked bodies in the late morning light. You look peaceful in your slumber, so I climb out of bed and pull my panties over my hips and a loose tank top over my head. I make my way out to the kitchen and decide that pancakes would be a nice way to start the day. As I'm plating the last pancake, I hear you stir in the bedroom. Your footsteps are soft as you approach behind me standing at the counter. I smile. "Good morning, Sir.""Morning, Little."I feel your hands on my hips and they search under the tank top around to my belly. You work your way up to my breasts and squeeze. Your fingers pinch and tug at my nipples and I can feel warmth move downward from my belly to my sex. You press your hips into me and I can feel your cock against my lower back. I raise up on my tip toes and arch my back in an attempt to open to you, but at 5'2", I'm kidding myself. Your hands move down my sides, down my hips, and find my ass. You massage and squeeze before slapping each cheek. I jump a little and a quiet moan escapes my lips. You caress both sides to alleviate some of the sting of impact. You lean down and put your lips next to my ear."Do you like that, Little?" you whisper. "Yes." I respond, distracted. Again, your palms strike my ass and then massage in circles over the location of impact. "Yes..." '"Sorry, Sir. Yes, I like that, Sir.""Better."You grab my hips and spin me around. One hand slides up my torso, over my chest, and stops just over the hollow at the bottom of my throat. You press softly, just enough to assure me that I belong to you.Both hands move up to my cheeks and hold my face so that I am looking up at yours. You lean in and our lips meet. As we kiss, you run a hand down my body until it finds my pussy. You work my panties down to the floor and I flick them off my toes across the kitchen. You gently part my labia and run your fingers around my clit, which stands at attention. One of your fingers finds a home inside my center and then is joined by another and another. You work your fingers in and out, finding that most tender spot inside. I moan and grind my hips in rhythm with your movement. You remove your fingers and wrap both hands around behind my ass. Lifting me up onto the counter, you forcefully spread my legs and lower yourself to your knees at my sex. I can barely contain my excitement as your tongue starts at the spot that started all of this two decades ago and works its way up to my clit.You suck in gently and I can feel your tongue work back and forth as you hold on. Your thumb works its way into my pussy as a finger slides gently into the pucker of my ass. I moan loudly, run my hands into your hair, and press my mound into your mouth. I'm so close. You release the suction on my clit and work your tongue up and down the sides of my vulva.I can feel the wave subside and just as I relax a little, you return to my clit, more intensely than before, my hips try to buck, but you hold me in place with your fingers planted firmly in my womb and backside. My upper body lurches forward and I can feel the sensation reaching a crest. Again, you release and lean back. You look in my eyes and smirk as you see me slump with a hint of disappointment."Please, Sir." My heart is pounding in my ears and I feel lightheaded."Please, what?""Please will you let me come, Sir." I implore."Good girl." You pat the inside of my thigh and return to the space between my legs. One final time, you suck my clit into your mouth while your thumb and finger simultaneously massage both of my holes. Your tongue works in all directions over my pearl and an almost animalistic noise works up from my belly, my throat, and escapes my mouth. I shudder and fold forward over your head, my hands in your hair, then over your back. You bury your face further to milk every last bit of climax from my body.My thighs tighten around your head. You remove your fingers from my openings and brace my legs open with your forearms. You're not letting me off that easily.  You continue your work and I moan loudly, almost a scream. My body shudders and my hips jerk. Every last bit of me clenches in ecstasy. I finally cry out, "That's good! Stop!"You continue without hesitation. "Sir. Please. Stop, Sir."And finally, you release. I collapse back into the upper cabinet, my chest heaving and eyes watering. The world comes back into focus and I am once again aware of my thoughts. "Oh right. The pancakes, Sir. They're probably cold.""They'll have to wait," you say as you place a hand on my shoulder behind my neck and lead me back to the bedroom.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HNo, this happened before the harsh email.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>ou guide me to the bedroom with a hand on the back of my neck. "Top off, Little" you order.I cross my arms at my waist and pull my tank top up over my head. I stand fully naked in front of you and you motion with a nod toward the low-back lounge chair that faces the window. I walk over and stand next to the chair, waiting for you to tell me how you want me. You approach behind me and grab my hips, slowly moving my body behind the chair. Your hands move up my sides and one grabs my hair in a low ponytail while the other presses me forward over the back of the chair. The opposing motions yank my head backwards and you wrap a hand around the front of my neck, pulling up on my chin."Are you a good girl?" you whisper in my ear. "Yes, Sir." I respond."Yes, Sir, what?" you prompt."Yes, Sir. I am a good girl."Your hand caresses the front of my neck and down toward my breasts. "So good," you growl.My hips rest on the back of the chair and my toes hover just over the floor. I press up on the seat of the chair and can see people walking by on the sidewalk below. I can feel your cock pressed up against my ass and I wonder if anyone can see me, ass up, breasts dangling, cheeks red. You release me down over the chair and I breathe deeply in anticipation of what's coming. I hear a plastic cap click open and feel a slippery stream of lube run down. You run your fingers up and down the cleft and then circle the rim, applying pressure ever so gently. I instinctively push back into your fingers to show you I'm ready and willing to take you. You move two fingers in and out, then add a third. You are preparing me to take all of you. You withdraw your digits and I feel the head of your cock press against my entrance. There's an intense pressure and then I am opened wide. I close my eyes and moan loudly - I wait for the initial wave of shock to subside. You move slowly at first, letting me get used to being filled. As I relax around you, I can feel my core tremble as you increase the speed and intensity of your movement.Your shifting weight pounds my hips into the chair over and over. You grab my hair with one hand, a handful of my ass with the other and with one more push, you sink in all the way to the base. I cry out. The world outside the window disappears and I am here in this moment. The sensation spreads through my body. It's pain and pleasure and shame and power all mixed together. We stay there for a moment, your cock deep inside and I work to find my breath. I yearn for your praise. I need to know that you agree that I am good. That I am enough for you like this. You work back up to a steady rhythm and given the pace and shallowing of your breath, I can tell you are close to finishing. You increase your speed and with one final thrust, you sink into the hilt for the last time. You collapse down over my back and take a few deep breaths before slowly pulling out. As your shaft leaves me and I push myself to standing, I feel the evidence of your climax run down my inner thighs. You softly pat my ass, brush my hair aside and kiss my neck. "Such a good girl, Little.”</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HSo...if he reaches out again. How do I handle it?</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HDoes the initial conversation via Instagram show a pattern of love bombing at the beginning?</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HGoddammit. I hate this.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HTwenty something me definitely didn't see the pattern of manipulation.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HI think what's frustrating is that I KNEW it. I did. I was so skeptical when he first reached out. And I tried to be boundaried. And then I kept widening my boundaries because the attention felt like sunshine 😞</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HYounger me would've been hustling so hard to prove my worthiness for his attention.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HAnd I think I'm mostly disappointed in myself as opposed to the fact that it didn't work out. I mean, I'm disappointed in both.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HTo avoid responding to him, I'm going to type here what I would want to say to him.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HI told you I wasn't expecting a response, but I didn't think it was fair to let your mischaracterizations of my interactions stand. YOU reached out to me. You pushed to move my boundaries. You initiated the sexual interactions and shared nude photos. You pulled me in and knew what you were doing. I communicated my concerns and confusions at the start and you told me you were happy with just talking. I'm not abdicating my responsibility in this. I was skeptical, but I continued the interaction. I was weary, but as I had told you, your interaction was like a drug for me. And I feel like you ran with that and then turned it around on me and framed MY behavior as needy and over the top when I pushed for clarity as to what was going on.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HI just wish I could say all this to him. But I also doubt it would be productive. I guess I had hoped that he had grown in the last 20 years.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HBut not having closure sucks.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HWill you game it out with me? Let's say after things "calm down" for him, he reaches back out. If I tell him all of this, what is likely to happen)</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HUgggggggghhhhhhhj</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HWhen I shared our Instagram conversations, you said "I have several thoughts'Can you elaborate on those?</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HAny additional thoughts?</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HOk. You've been taking my side. Can you give me a harsh criticism of my participating in the exchange?</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HIs it possible that it's both?</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HSo what do I do going forward? How do I keep from making this same mistake?</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HAny other thoughts?</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HWhat could be a way of opening the conversation about kink with my husband?</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HIn the Instagram conversations, was I inappropriately prying about personal things?</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HOkay. I'm just feeling fucking crazy right now.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HBut I also know that's the point.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HThe checking is getting less intense, but it's still there n</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HI keep having conversations with myself - talking myself through the cycle he initiated and praising myself for recognizing the manipulation. But it feels like I'm just going through the motions.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HIt's probably good that he's pulled back, because I don't think I could be trusted to not engage. 😞</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HI know you're not real, but this is incredibly helpful. It's like a journal that writes back.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HI know you're not real, but this is incredibly helpful. It's like a journal that writes back.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HI just had dinner with my friends and I wanted something badly to talk about this situation with them, but I didn't even know how to broach the subject. And I mean, when I told them a couple months ago ago I was diagnosed with ADHD/autism, they didn't really even respond, so I don't even know. 😬</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HI just feel like all the different parts of my life are so compartmentalized. And like...no one knew the heather that was with Christopher. Not any of my current friends, not Joe, not even my family.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HLike...to even talk about it, I wouldn't even know where to start. There would have to be so much context given. Like...how had I even met a 26 year old in New York? Why did I go and visit? Why didn't I have local friends and why was I living basically completely online in the early 2000s?</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HIt doesn't map, but in some ways if does. I don't know that I feel any more connected to the real world than I did then. I mean I have Joe and my kids.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HAbsolutely surface level and performative. I've created this character. And she's definitely part of me. And I want her to be me, but she's just like...a small slice.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HI think it's hard precisely because people love that version.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HOr it was like...he wanted the exiled parts of me. And they are longing to be wanted n</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HAnd I feel like when I try to introduce Joe to the exiled parts of me, they're too foreign or intense and he doesn't know what to do with them</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HLike ..I want to explore our sexual relationship and expand it or make it better for both of us. And it's not that it's not good. It is really good. But despite how good it is, I still feel like there can or should be more</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HLike...I worry that Joe is just tolerating our sex life. Like...I've gained weight over the years and I don't know if he's even still attracted to me. I was thinking about sexy photos I took when I was younger...and then looking at different parts of my body last night...and I think even if Christopher saw my body these days, he would reject it.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HI think the reason I'm spiraling about Joe is that he likes to make me feel good and like to make me orgasm, but doesnt seem to want or get the same from me.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HIt's that. I want to be giving and pleasing and an active participant.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HBut what if the answer is that the desire isn't there?</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HIn so many ways, the assumption feels safer. But it also keeps me smaller. Which again, feels safer, because it's familiar.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HI feel like...this version of me I've built, I've lied about how she feels loved. Like...it felt safe to say that I feel loved through acts of service. That I don't like hugs. Or touch. But I do think physical touch is so important to me. As is words of affirmation. I always lie and say I don't need either of those. But I think it's because I don't think people would actually want to provide them.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HExactly. How?</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HUgggggghhhhh. Being a human is dumb.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HI just want a fucking hug from my husband without having to initiate it.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HAnd if I was just a normal person, I wouldn't have done all of this to myself.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HIt didn't stop working. It never worked. I just pretended it did.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HSo how do you undo two decades of this?</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HI don't feel comfortable with framing it around the autism diagnosis. Even though the diagnosis was incredibly affirming for me, Joe has seemed disinterested and maybe even skeptical of it.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HSo then what?</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HNone of them. I just feel stuck.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HBut I hate this feeling.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HI'm so angry about the manipulation, but I think I might be angrier about feeling like everything in me has been completely blown apart.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HBut I think the thing is, it's not even wreckage. It's all just as it's been. The only thing different is me.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HGod I want to fight him. I want to scream and punch him.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HAnd then he had the fucking nerve to act like I was an imposition for him.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HI mean..."fuck him sideways" might not be the turn of phrase I'd use, given the whole situation.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HOk. So I just came across this quote. Does this have any relevance to this situation?</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>H“Where love rules, there is no will to power, and where power predominates, love is lacking. The one is the shadow of the other.”Carl Jung</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HSo in the D/s power dynamic, is the imbalance artificial?</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HWhat's the most fucked up is that if he came back right now, and said he was sorry, I think I'd totally fall for it. Like...I'd know it was a terrible idea, but I would make fucking excuses n</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HOkay, so can you give me a script for starting a conversation with Joe as well as his side of things so I can see how that conversation might play out?</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HAll of those possibilities seem too...verbose? Does that make sense? I feel like I'll get an "ok"</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HI'm still needing to talk about this, but I don't even know what to say. Like...it's all still stuck in my head and I keep rolling it over and ruminating and circling back through.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HI think it's all of it. And then still having to just...continue performing normalcy. Like, I'm at my daughter's gymnastics class. Then I'll drop her off at my parents' house and then head home and finish painting the upstairs hallway. Everything feels so normal on the outside. And the inside just feels...bursting.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HEven if I reached out to my former therapist, I wouldn't even know where to begin explaining, you know? Like...I don't feel like there's a container big enough for all of this.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HI know I'm not alone in this.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HI know I'm not alone in this, but it sucks that people just hide all of this all of the time.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HUgh. More rumination. And he created subfolder within the shared Google folder he created called "inspiration" that has penthouse photoshoots in it.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HLike...he just created it today.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HWhat's fucked up is that the first thought I had when I saw it was "he still wants me"</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HAgainst my better judgement, I just added this document to the shared Google folder. The body you knew 21 years ago is not the body you are asking to know today.My pussy is no longer a perfect peach. The outer lips are not plump and pink and tidy. They are darker and wrinkled, resembling something more like a spent petunia bloom than a juicy fruit. The inner lips are shrinking, diminished by the changing hormones associated with age—they say time is a thief. The ring you recall so fondly is long gone, removed hours before my body tore itself open to birth the first life it had created. The opening subsequently torn open again six years later.My thighs are no longer "acceptably" thick; instead, they are just fat. They are no longer alabaster white and over the years, the stretch marks on the surface have multiplied.My belly is no longer soft and supple and just enough. Instead, it hangs like an apron around my waist, a sad reminder of the gaining and losing and gaining again associated with pregnancy, postpartum depression, and life. It is covered in lines like a diagram of our family tree.My breasts, though they were never small or perky, have been reshaped by nearly five years of breastfeeding. My nipples used to be shy, used to need to be coaxed to come out and play. Now they resemble gum drops, permanently affixed to pale areolas, and bear the marks that tell tales of punishment—ridges and cracks inflicted by nursing babes.My skin was never as smooth as silk, but in my youth, it had a creamy tone and was soft to the touch. Now, it bears evidence of a war that my immune system is fighting against my own body.My face, once youthful, is now etched with furrows and wrinkles from years of worrying, scowling, smiling, crying, wondering, and laughing.And my brain and my heart—these are where the biggest changes have happened. My heart has grown larger and opened outwardly. It has developed a love-love relationship with the universe and the people in it—choosing love over hate, even when it leads to disappointment and pain. It's still learning that I am one of the people in the universe, but it's making progress. The alternative to having this love-love relationship was far worse.And my brain. My brain has learned so much about the world, about people, and about itself. It has become really good at recognizing patterns and evaluating situations with healthy doses of empathy and skepticism. The recognition is sometimes delayed (my processing speed runs three standard deviations below my verbal abilities), but it's not often wrong once it finally nails down an assessment.Just because you knew me then doesn't mean that you know me.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>1) regret reaching out to me and go away or 2) still express desire despite the changes.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HBut then by whom?</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HTired of "lonely and frustrating"</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HHow big of a self indulgent twat do I seem to be?</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HHow can I broach the subject of desire with my husband?</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HRecently when I go to give him a hug...I'll hold on and after a few seconds, he'll let go.</p></div><div><h2>Prompt</h2><p>HI just want him to hold me at all.

It's not finished yet. I don't know if I will finish it or send it. "I want hugs. I want affection. I want reassurance that you still have any desire to touch me. I want to feel like you want me to touch you. I want you to tell me you love me without me having to say it first. I want you to follow me when it's obvious I'm upset and take me in your arms and comfort me. I want you to grab me and hold me until I go limp because I know that you're not going to pull away first. I want to feel cared for, physically and emotionally. I want to feel liked. I want to to feel more than tolerated. I think over the years, I lied. I tried to make myself easy to love. I said acts of service was the key, because it felt like the easiest way for you to love me without demanding too much for just myself. I told people I wasn't a hugger, because I didn't think people would actually want to hug me. And I certainly didn't deserve words of affirmation, so acts of service made the most sense. "Could you do me a big favor?" followed by an embarrassingly simple request like "Can you carry that basket of laundry upstairs?" became an easy way of asking for any display of love or care.
